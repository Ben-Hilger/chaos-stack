    <div class="mt-5 mb-1 font-bold">What is the Chaos Stack?</div>
    <div>The chaos stack is a simple CRUD application designed to have multiple backends(and eventually frontend)
      frameworks and programming languages that are easily interchangeable with each other. The pair is randomly
      assigned when the page is loaded.</div>
    <div class="font-semibold mt-1"> Want to potentially see a different pair? Refresh the page!</div>
    <div class="mt-5 mb-1 font-bold">Why create the chaos stack?</div>
    <div class="mb-5">
      The chaos stack provides an easy playground to explore and learn the basics of different programming languages and
      showcase that learning. I also hope to expand past the initial view and add more features to this website
